Overview: 

Browse Pokémon cards from any card set and 'favorite' them, saving a list of favorited cards to local storage.

APP INSTRUCTIONS:

Initial screen shows the list of loaded cards. Each page loads a maximum of 25 Pokémon. Tap on a Pokémon to open a picture of its card, as well as see the card's artist and card set. To exit the Card view, simply tap the 'X' icon in the top left corner.
